# Core ML Experiment

This is a demo Swift application that uses a few open source Core ML models to do analysis against static & live camera images.

The project includes the models for MobileNet, SqueezeNet and GooglePlaces.  Inceptionv3 is too large to include so to include that model go to https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/Inceptionv3.mlmodel and download the Inception model and drop into the XCode project with the other models.
